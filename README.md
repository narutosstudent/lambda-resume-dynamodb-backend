The backend for my resume while doing the Cloud Resume Challenge.

This uses AWS Lambda and DynamoDB.

# Development

To test the functions locally, use `node-lambda`. `node-lambda setup` to set up all the files and make sure to include the necessary values in the `.env` file. Then you can just run `node-lambda run`.
